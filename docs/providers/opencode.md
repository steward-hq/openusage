# OpenCode

Tracks your OpenCode-hosted usage — the **Go** subscription and the **Zen** pay-as-you-go gateway. Go
plan windows come from OpenCode's official usage API. Spend tiles and the usage trend still come from
OpenCode's logs already on your Mac.

## What it tracks

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Session | Go usage in the rolling 5-hour window, as a percent, with the reset countdown |
| Weekly | Go usage this week, as a percent (resets Monday UTC) |
| Monthly | Go usage this billing cycle, as a percent |
| Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days | Local cost and tokens across all your OpenCode-hosted usage (Go + Zen) |
| Usage Trend | A day-by-day sparkline of tokens over the last month |

When you have the Go subscription, OpenUsage shows "Go" beside the provider name.

The Session / Weekly / Monthly meters are **account-wide** — the same percents the OpenCode dashboard
shows, including usage from other machines. If you only use the Zen pay-as-you-go gateway (no Go
subscription), the cap meters are hidden and you'll just see the spend tiles.

## Shared limits hub (optional)

To use the same Go meters as AI Limits on your phone, add `"opencode"` to
`~/.openusage/limits-hub.json` (see [Muse Code](muse.md#shared-limits-hub-optional) for the full
config shape and freshness rules):

```json
{
  "snapshotURL": "https://your-hub.example:4401/snapshot.json",
  "providers": ["opencode"],
  "resetTimeZone": "UTC"
}
```

Once configured, the Session / Weekly / Monthly meters come exclusively from the hub — OpenUsage
does not call opencode.ai for them, and no local Go key is needed on this Mac (the hub holds the
account session; the "Go" plan badge still shows). The local spend tiles and usage trend keep
working as usual. A hub failure shows a warning while the local tiles continue. The hub listing
also turns the provider on automatically, even without a local key.

## Where credentials come from

Use OpenCode as usual. OpenUsage reads the `opencode-go` API key from OpenCode's local data directory
(`~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`, or `$OPENCODE_DATA_DIR` / `$XDG_DATA_HOME` if you've set them) and
sends it as a Bearer token to the usage API. There's no login prompt and no token to paste. Spend tiles
still read the local SQLite logs in that same directory.

When OpenCode uses its built-in ChatGPT Pro/Plus OAuth login, that usage belongs to the Codex
subscription and appears in OpenUsage's **Codex** spend tiles and trend. It is not mixed into the
OpenCode-hosted Go + Zen totals. Its separate per-request token buckets are estimated with the same
cache, long-context, and fast/priority rules as native Codex usage. Ordinary OpenAI API-key traffic is
not attributed to Codex.

## The meters and spend tiles

Go meters are percents from `GET https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage` — OpenCode's own accounting, not
an estimate. Each spend tile shows cost and tokens together (`$4.08 · 1.2M tokens`), the same as Claude /
Codex / Cursor. Those dollars come straight from the per-message cost OpenCode records for its hosted
gateways on this Mac, so they can be lower than account-wide Go usage. A period with no recorded local
usage reads "No data" rather than a misleading `$0.00`. No log data leaves your Mac.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Session / Weekly / Monthly meters** — those are Go-plan windows. You'll see them when you're
  logged into OpenCode Go (`opencode-go` in `auth.json`) and the key has an active subscription.
  Zen-only users see the spend tiles instead.
- **"OpenCode Go key was rejected"** — the local key was not accepted. Log into OpenCode Go again so
  `auth.json` is rewritten.
- **"No OpenCode Go subscription on this key"** — the key is valid but this account isn't on Go. The
  spend tiles still work if you use Zen locally.
- **"Couldn't read OpenCode's auth.json"** — the file exists but is unreadable or not valid JSON. Check
  its permissions, or log into OpenCode Go again to rewrite it.
- **Spend tiles show "No data"** — OpenUsage needs OpenCode's local database at
  `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode*.db`. Run an OpenCode session, then refresh.
- **"Couldn't read OpenCode's local database"** — the database (or data directory) exists but couldn't be
  read this refresh. If you're on Go, the percent meters still refresh; quit OpenCode and refresh to
  restore the tiles. If it persists, check the permissions on `~/.local/share/opencode`.
- **Shared hub warning** — check Tailscale and the hub collector. Renew the browser session on the hub
  if it reports `needs-session`; re-logging into OpenCode on this Mac does not update the hub.

## Under the hood

Go windows: `GET https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage` with the `opencode-go` key as `Authorization:
Bearer …`. The response is `{ usage: { rolling, weekly, monthly } }`, each with `percent` and
`resetsAt`. A 401 is a rejected key; a 403 `EntitlementError` means no Go subscription.

Spend tiles and trend: assistant-message `cost` and token fields from every `opencode*.db` in the data
directory (OpenCode partitions its database by release channel — stable is `opencode.db`, the preview
line is `opencode-next.db` — so all channels are unioned). Both `opencode-go` (Go) and `opencode` (Zen)
count. Read-only.
